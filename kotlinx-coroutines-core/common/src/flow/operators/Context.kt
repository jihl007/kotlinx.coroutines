/**
 * Buffers flow emissions via channel of a specified capacity and runs collector in a separate coroutine.
 *
 * Normally, [flows][Flow] are _sequential_. It means that the code of all operators is executed in the
 * same coroutine. For example, consider the following code using [onEach] and [collect] operators:
 *
 * ```
 * flowOf("A", "B", "C")
 *     .onEach  { println("1$it") }
 *     .collect { println("2$it") }
 * ```
 *
 * It is going to be executed in the following order by the coroutine `Q` that calls this code:
 *
 * ```
 * Q : -->-- [1A] -- [2A] -- [1B] -- [2B] -- [1C] -- [2C] -->--
 * ```
 *
 * So if the operator's code takes considerable time to execute, then the total execution time is going to be
 * the sum of execution times for all operators.
 *
 * The `buffer` operator creates a separate coroutine during execution for the flow it applies to.
 * Consider the following code:
 *
 * ```
 * flowOf("A", "B", "C")
 *     .onEach  { println("1$it") }
 *     .buffer()  // <--------------- buffer between onEach and collect
 *     .collect { println("2$it") }
 * ```
 *
 * It will use two coroutines for execution of the code. A coroutine `Q` that calls this code is
 * going to execute `collect`, and the code before `buffer` will be executed in a separate
 * new coroutine `P` concurrently with `Q`:
 *
 * ```
 * P : -->-- [1A] -- [1B] -- [1C] ---------->--  // flowOf(...).onEach { ... }
 *
 *                       |
 *                       | channel               // buffer()
 *                       V
 *
 * Q : -->---------- [2A] -- [2B] -- [2C] -->--  // collect
 * ```
 *
 * When operator's code takes time to execute this decreases the total execution time of the flow.
 * A [channel][Channel] is used between the coroutines to send elements emitted by the coroutine `P` to
 * the coroutine `Q`. If the code before `buffer` operator (in the coroutine `P`) is faster than the code after
 * `buffer` operator (in the coroutine `Q`), then this channel will become full at some point and will suspend
 * the producer coroutine `P` until the consumer coroutine `Q` catches up.
 * The [capacity] parameter defines the size of this buffer.
 *
 * Adjacent applications of [channelFlow], [flowOn], [buffer], [produceIn], and [broadcastIn] are
 * always fused so that only one properly configured channel is used for execution.
 *
 * ### Conceptual implementation
 *
 * The actual implementation of `buffer` is not trivial due to the fusing, but conceptually its
 * implementation is equivalent to the following code that can be written using [produce]
 * coroutine builder to produce a channel and [consumeEach][ReceiveChannel.consumeEach] extension to consume it:
 *
 * ```
 * fun <T> Flow<T>.buffer(capacity: Int = DEFAULT): Flow<T> = flow {
 *     coroutineScope { // limit the scope of concurrent producer coroutine
 *         val channel = produce(capacity = capacity) {
 *             collect { send(it) } // send all to channel
 *         }
 *         // emit all received values
 *         channel.consumeEach { emit(it) }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param capacity capacity of the buffer between coroutines. Allowed values are the same as in `Channel(...)`
 * factory function: [DEFAULT][Channel.DEFAULT_BUFFER] (by default), [CONFLATED][Channel.CONFLATED],
 * [RENDEZVOUS][Channel.RENDEZVOUS], [UNLIMITED][Channel.UNLIMITED] or a non-negative value indicating
 * a requested size.

/**
 * The operator that changes the context where this flow is executed to the given [context].
 * This operator is composable and affects only preceding operators that do not have its own context.
 * This operator is context preserving: [context] **does not** leak into the downstream flow.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```
 * withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
 *     val singleValue = intFlow // will be executed on IO if context wasn't specified before
 *         .map { ... } // Will be executed in IO
 *         .flowOn(Dispatchers.IO)
 *         .filter { ... } // Will be executed in Default
 *         .flowOn(Dispatchers.Default)
 *         .single() // Will be executed in the Main
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * For more explanation of context preservation please refer to [Flow] documentation.
 *
 * This operators retains a _sequential_ nature of flow if changing the context does not call for changing
 * the [dispatcher][CoroutineDispatcher]. Otherwise, if changing dispatcher is required, it collects
 * flow emissions in one coroutine that is run using a specified [context] and emits them from another coroutines
 * with the original collector's context using a channel with a [default][Channel.DEFAULT_BUFFER] buffer size
 * between two coroutines similarly to [buffer] operator, unless [buffer] operator is explicitly called
 * before or after `flowOn`, which requests buffering behavior and specifies channel size.
 *
 * Adjacent applications of [channelFlow], [flowOn], [buffer], [produceIn], and [broadcastIn] are
 * always fused so that only one properly configured channel is used for execution.
 *
 * @throws [IllegalArgumentException] if provided context contains [Job] instance.
